- 🔎 you can also `search` for articles using the search box *(how cool ikr)*
- 🎲 you can also click the [random posts](/random) link to be taken to a **random post**...
- 🔢 ...or you can click the [archive](/archive) link to view a list of **every post** I've ever written!

- 🏡 you can click the <i class="fa-solid fa-house fa-sm"></i> **house icon** or the words **{weblog-title}** at the top to come back to this homepage at any time!
