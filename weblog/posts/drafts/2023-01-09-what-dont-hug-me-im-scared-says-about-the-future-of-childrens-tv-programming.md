# What "Don't Hug Me, I'm Scared" Says About The Future Of Children's TV Programming

Hey there! Welcome back to another blog post. It's been too long since my last post, and I'm bored, so why not work out my creative muscles and write a blog post about something that I've had some serious thoughts on for a while, but never got to tell anyone about.

For those who don't know what ["*Don't Hug Me, I'm Scared*"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZOnoLKzoBItcEk5OsES2TA) is, it's a surrealist YouTube series started in 2011, split into 6 separate videos. Each video is filmed in the style of a children's television show, and each video starts off fun and happy, only to devolve into one of the most psychologically disturbing themes I've ever seen.

If you haven't seen it, I ***strongly*** urge you to go watch it on YouTube right now, before reading my blog post. This blog post __**WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS**__, and I am giving you this warning right now so that you have a chance to see it for yourself before being spoiled. Oh, and it's a really good YouTube series anyways that absolutely deserves your views.

I'll be putting each video's analysis in it's own sub-heading, so without further ado, let's dive right in!

## Bad Things That Could Happen

["Bad Things That Could Happen"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hIKKYv_3Ic) is what I like to see as a "prequel" to the series. It was posted to YouTube on November 9th, 2010, and is 5 minutes and 9 seconds long.

Upon initial viewing, it may seem very non-sensical and chaotic, especially without any prior context to the video. Just know that everything portrayed in this video is meant to act as an appetizer for what's about to come.

In the video, you see a pencil writing out the words "bad things that could happpen *(sic)*", while various...well, bad...things happen.

A hammer hits a water pipe causing a massive water leak, a sandwich goes bad and bacteria grows on it, a stray cigarette causes a huge fire, a mouse trap kills a curious mouse, a guy holding a spoon tries to crack an egg, only for the egg yolk to...try to float away?

I believe that this episode really has no major significance to the rest of the series, instead serving as more of an introduction to the art style of the series. Some of the objects and "bad things" in this episode do make a comeback in later episodes, such as the egg being cracked, but other than that I don't see much meaning in it. The fact that cigarettes are being shown on a children's television program *could* possibly be of significance, but at the same time they aren't promoting the cigarettes, they are quite literally doing the opposite by showing what can happen if you don't put out a cigarette.

Ultimately, if I had to try to extrapolate some form of meaning from this episode, I would probably say that this episode resembles "pure" children's programming, without any form of outside influence affecting it. Later on in my analysis, we'll see how exterior forces can influence children's programming for the worse, and this episode acts as a baseline as to what "normal" (relatively speaking) children's television should look like.

So with that said, let's move right along!

## Episode 1

Episode 1 of DHMIS starts off immediately with "hidden" (although, not really) references. We're shown a zoom-in shot of a postcard, followed by a close-up shot of a newspaper titled *The Right Wing*. I interpret this as a reference to how politics tend to be the primary influencer behind major shifts and changes in children's television programming.

Next we're shown some objects on a shelf, followed by a shot of a calendar with the date set on June 19th. This video was published in 2011. June 19th of 2011 was Father's Day. Take note of that and remember it, it'll be significant later.

We're shown various shots around the house, and then a shot of a sticky note with the words "get creative" written on it. This is a foreshadow as to what's about to happen in this episode.

We then see our 3 main characters: Red Guy, Yellow Guy, and Bird Guy, sitting at the dinner table in the kitchen. These will be our 3 main characters throughout the entirety of DHMIS.

Then, out of completely nowhere, the notebook on the dinner table flips itself open, revealing that it is able to talk and see. Our characters engage in a sing-along with the notebook about the concept of creativity, which the notebook initiates.

The notebook asks "when you look at this orange, what do you see?", to which Bird Guy responds that it's "just a boring old orange". The notebook then replies, stating "maybe to you, but not to me. I see a silly face!". Bird Guy replies stating that he doesn't see what the notebook sees, and the notebook tells Bird Guy that it's because he's not "thinking creatively".

Note that at this point in the video, we're already starting to see signs of exterior manipulation. What used to be a cheerful children's program is starting to be messed with by individuals that are currently unknown to us. All we are aware of is that manipulation is occurring, and that this notebook is trying it's hardest to influence our main characters into seeing things the *exact* same way as him, which is ironic considering how his entire song is about being creative, and in a way, unique. You'll soon come to see that any form of creativity not explicitly approved by the notebook is going to be forbidden and even punished, again, making our notebook the hypocrite in this episode.
