# how it's been lately (and other stuff)

hey there! long time no blog posts lol. just wanted to provide an update regarding how my life's been lately, because I haven't done one of these in a while.

anyways, let's jump right in!

### dispatch training
I am officially solo in dispatch now! super excited üòÅ and I'm also the first one out of my entire class to go solo in anything (dispatch or call-taking). so far I've been loving dispatch, and everyone on my squad has not only been supportive but also extremely kind and amazing! now that I'm solo I'm also eligible for overtime, and I've already worked some OT, most of it mandatory. I might sign up for voluntary OT because I'd rather volunteer than be volun-told, but idk yet...

### 2023 is here!
happy new year to everyone reading! 2023 is finally here, and hopefully it's a better year for all of us. 2022 was overall pretty bad (don't get me wrong though, there were some good things to have happened in 2022), let's hope 2023 is better... üëÄ

### conclusion
that's mostly it. nothing too much has happened in a while, so this blog post is kinda short lol. I'll try to put one of these out within the next month or so, depending on whether or not anything interesting happens within that time frame. if not, then within the next 2 months should be enough time for something blog-worthy to happen.

take care everyone, and stay safe! <3
