# Long Time No See!

Hey there everyone! I just wanted to write this blog post because I haven't written one in a while and provide you all with a quick update of what's been going on in my personal life lol

Overall things have been going pretty well. I did get involved in a critical incident at work, which has made me feel more stressed out than usual. I'm not going to go into detail about exactly what happened due to non-disclosure agreements that have been signed and confidentiality and what not, but I have spoken to several people who have helped tremendously with managing that added stress. I'm so incredibly thankful that I have such an excellent support system, full of people who care about me and my well-being and want to see me succeed <3

Other than that, I've just been chilling. I've had quite a bit of overtime lately, so I still haven't managed to find much time to do anything else. I have more overtime in the future, so I doubt I'll be able to get enough free time to do anything anytime soon, which sucks but oh well. I'm just trying to make the most of the time that I do have to relax and unwind.

I've been enjoying my Nintendo Switch quite a bit lately. I think I've put the most hours into Splatoon 3 compared to any other game I own, not to say that the other games I own suck or anything. I think a close 2nd place would be Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I might make a page somewhere where I share my custom design creator ID and dream address, but I'm still thinking over it.

I've also decided to retire the `sanel.page` domain entirely. I feel like `sanel.omg.lol` works perfectly fine as a domain and seeing as how I've got `sanel.omg.lol` paid in advance for the next 5 years, it's kind of a waste to have `sanel.page`. For now, I've decided to disable it entirely. Anything that had a `sanel.page` domain is now on its own subdomain (for instance, my blog is now on `sanel.weblog.lol`, my pastebin is now on `sanel.paste.lol`, my website is now on `sanel.omg.lol`, my images are now on `sanel.some.pics`, etc), and sending email to `sanel.page` will no longer work at all. I've gone ahead and parked the `sanel.page` domain until it expires because if I had deleted it immediately, some jackass could snatch it up right away and make it point to something malicious or downright illegal, and tarnish my name in the process. And I don't want that. I'm not sure what I'll do with the domain once it expires, but I'll figure something out.

Other than that, I hope everyone reading this is doing well! Stay tuned for the next blog post, which will be coming at some point in the near future (hopefully!) I love you all, and I hope you all stay safe and healthy! <33
