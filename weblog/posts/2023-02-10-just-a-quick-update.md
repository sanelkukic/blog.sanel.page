# Just A Quick Update

Hi there everyone! Just wanted to post a quick blog post providing an update as to how things have been lately. I know I haven't posted anything in a while and I wanted this to serve as a confirmation that I'm not dead or anything lol.

## what's been going on?

i've been extremely busy lately with a ton of overtime at work. in addition, i also have quite a few personal appointments and things to take care of coming up very soon. i'm so sorry for not being able to post anything in a while, but i promise you once i finish all of these things i will immediately post again!

the DHMIS post is still in the drafts, you can actually see a preview of it on github [right now](https://github.com/sanelkukic/blog.sanel.page/tree/main/weblog/posts/drafts/2023-01-09-what-dont-hug-me-im-scared-says-about-the-future-of-childrens-tv-programming.md) if you're curious where exactly i'm at with it. i haven't been able to make much progress as of late but trust me, i will soon.

## what else?

i still have yet to finish my FAA drone training course, again because i've been very busy with other things. i need to finish that as soon as possible as well, and then take the certification exam which will require me to schedule another appointment.

i also have my FL 911 PST exam coming up in a few days. i feel pretty ready, but i'm just gonna go over the study material one more time before i take it. it's gonna eat up a lot of my time too, so there's that.

i'm doing well in NCIC training, and i'm actually enjoying it quite a lot. i've been interested in NCIC ever since i was in the classroom when i first got hired, and it's exciting to finally be training in it.

anyways, that's about it. like i said, sorry for not posting much lately, but i just wanted to provide a quick update as to where i'm at with things and what to expect in the future. stay tuned for more posts coming soon, and i hope all of you have an amazing day! ðŸ˜Š
